# Hospital databse
 
We will be making a standalone application with a database storing information about diabetic patients from a hundred and thirty hospitals from the years 1999-2008. Having a database in the domain of healthcare is important as it serves as an efficient and organized environment to discover insights such as measuring the effectiveness of certain treatments or certain patterns that could indicate that a patient is more at risk for developing certain complications. 
The users of this application will be able to view and modify information regarding diabetic patients such as the time of their hospital admission, age, race, gender, length of stay, specific treatments performed, laboratory tests, etc as well as the hospital they received care at. There will also be an insert functionality for users to add new patients and hospitals, as well as a delete functionality to remove any patientâ€™s info. Queries based on user-input such as hospital name, Patient ID etc will be used to query the database and there will also be the option of pulling data from multiple sources if necessary.
